		<h1 class="typewriter">My story so far...</h1>
			<p>After more than a decade working in infrastructure manufacturing: downsizing and the closure of my place of work led to unemployment.
				<br>As I looked to re-enter the work force I decided that while scary and a bit uncertain, a career change was what I desired. A new and exciting chapter in my life! But what do I really love to do?</p>
			<P>One area of interest I have always enjoyed and excelled at was problem solving. Be it solving production or scheduling issues, understanding learning styles in order to train new employees or learning how to program a PLC to improve a process.
			<br>Another area of interest has been computers and technology. Here are some of the things I have done in the past for the fun and challenge but also for work related needs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>made simple programs and games in Basic (TRS-80, C=64 and Windows)</li>
				<li>used HTML to create websites for personal hobbies like sim racing and guitars (notepad, just notepad)</li>
				<li>learned enough PLC logic to reprogram limit switches in a manufacturing line (rslogix if I recall)</li>
				<li>setup private internet facing servers to play games with friends and family (MySQL, SQL Server 2017)</li>
				<li>made a virtual version of my living room in VR (Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender</li>
				<li>created and updated detailed linked spreadsheets to track and report efficiencies and KPIs (Excel)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thoughout my career and personal life I have had others say things like, <em>"You should be in IT."</em> or ,<em>"Why are you not in computer programming?"</em> and I would often say, <em>"I just do it for fun"</em>, or <em>"I don't have a compter science degree"</em>.</p>
